Use of BCrypt in LemnosLife:

Client side: https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/LemnosLife/blob/master/Client/Authentification/authentification.cpp

Server side: https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/LemnosLife/blob/master/Server/Authentification/auth.cpp

Use of Vigen√®re with a client key and a server key interleaved in LemnosLife (very low security but sufficient to avoid simple copy and paste of the game data):
