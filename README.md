# Lot of Java projects

This is a repository which stores a lot of my Java projects which help me sometimes to do an automated and easy job.

Java is a very good language for very basic algorithms (and for complex) but I used it a lot for basic tasks.

Many algorithms uploaded near the 12th june are very old codes. (that's why they look quite ugly and aren't very optimized)

I also got a lot of projects but I am not the main author, I just try to use them just to know how these technologies work, for instance: QR code reader, network interfaces... (not very interesting to reupload a code which can be yet found somewhere else on the World Wide Web)

Look at the description (and the discussion attached) for the last modified date of the specified algorithm.

I don't upload short algorithm (less than 50 lines or less than 1 Ko or not very interesting short code)
