# Lot-of-Java-projects
This is a quite messy repository which stores a lot of my Java projects which help me sometimes to do an automated and easy job.

Java is a very good language for very basic algorithms (and for complex) but I used it a lot for basic tasks.

Many algorithms uploaded near the 12th june are very old codes. (that's why they look quite ugly and aren't very optimized)
